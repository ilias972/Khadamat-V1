- Retries: 2 in CI, 0 locally
- Workers: 1 in CI, 2 locally
- Reporter: HTML
- Web server: Uses `npm run dev` command

### Running the Tests

To run the Playwright tests:

```bash
cd khadamat-frontend
npx playwright test
```

To run tests in headed mode (for debugging):

```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

To generate HTML report:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

### Recommendations

1. **Test Execution**: Run tests regularly as part of the CI/CD pipeline
2. **Test Maintenance**: Update fixtures and utilities as the application evolves
3. **Test Expansion**: Add more edge cases and error scenarios as needed
4. **Performance Testing**: Consider adding performance tests for critical paths
5. **Accessibility Testing**: Add accessibility tests for key user flows

### Known Limitations

1. Some tests rely on specific UI elements that may change
2. Network error testing is limited without actual network manipulation
3. Some tests may need adjustment based on actual API response times
4. Mobile-specific tests are not included in this initial suite

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the main user flows and can be extended as needed for additional functionality.
