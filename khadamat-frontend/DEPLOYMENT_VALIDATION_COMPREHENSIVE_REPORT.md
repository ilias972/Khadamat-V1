## 🔧 Technical Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix Cache Strategy Import**
   ```bash
   # Create missing cache strategy file
   touch khadamat-frontend/src/lib/cache-strategy.ts
   # Or update the import in signup page to use existing cache implementation
   ```

2. **Update Next.js Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Fix deprecated config warnings
   npm i baseline-browser-mapping@latest -D
   # Update next.config.js to use images.remotePatterns
   ```

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Bundle Size Reduction**: Main bundle at 90% of limit (450KB/500KB)
2. **API Performance**: Services endpoint at 96% of limit (675ms/700ms)
3. **Cache Strategy**: Implement comprehensive caching layer
